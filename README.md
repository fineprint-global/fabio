# FABIO v2 + wood
### The Food and Agriculture Biomass Input-Output database + wood commodities

FABIO provides a set of multi-regional physical supply-use and input-output tables covering global agriculture and forestry. The work is based on mostly freely available data from FAOSTAT, IEA, EIA, and UN Comtrade/BACI. FABIO currently covers 191 countries + RoW, 121 processes and 128 commodities for 1986-2013.

This repository provides all codes used to generate version 2 of the FABIO database.
