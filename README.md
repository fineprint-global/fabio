# FABIO v1.2

### The Food and Agriculture Biomass Input-Output database
FABIO provides a set of multi-regional physical supply-use and input-output tables covering global agriculture and forestry. The work is based on mostly freely available data from FAOSTAT, IEA, EIA, and UN Comtrade/BACI. FABIO currently covers 191 countries + RoW, 117 processes and 123 commodities for 1986-2020.

This repository provides all codes used to generate the FABIO database.
