This repository has been forked from [/fineprint-global/fabio](https://github.com/fineprint-global/fabio).

The fork added a script for importing the FABIO database in Python. In the meantime, [the script was committed to and merged into the original FABIO repository](https://github.com/fineprint-global/fabio/tree/master/python-import).
