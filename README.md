This repository was forked from [/fineprint-global/fabio](https://github.com/fineprint-global/fabio).

In this fork, a script for importing the FABIO database in Python was added. [The script has now been committed to and merged into the original FABIO repository](https://github.com/fineprint-global/fabio/tree/master/python-import).
