# FABIO Python import
The file `main.py` contains a script for importing some of the FABIO database's files in Python namely:

* E.rds
* io_codes.csv
* items.csv
* regions.csv
* X.rds
* Y.rds
* Z_mass.rds
* Z_value.rds

The files should be located in a folder specified by the variable `fabio_filepath` in `main.py` (e.g. `fabio_filepath = "C:/Users/JB/Downloads/"`).
